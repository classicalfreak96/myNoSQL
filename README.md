# myNoSQL

This was a semester long class project that was broken down into several segments. I worked with one other partner.

During this class, we studied, wrote, and implemented the code behind a working SQL database. Each homework covered a different aspect of implementation for an SQL database, which all come together to form a working, simplified database. 

This segment of the project is in a different repository because the code for noSQL is unrelated to the code for an SQL database.
